# Chroma Keying Project

This project implements an algorithm that extracts the green area from a video and replaces that green area with another video. The entire implementation was done using Python with OpenCV.

## Setup

You need to install OpenCV and NumPy to run this project.

When you execute, you need to pass the videos as arguments through the command line, following this format: `-vf path_to_video_with_green_screen.mp4 -vb path_to_background_video.mp4`.
